        <h1>About</h1>
    <p> Whenever I am finished with schoolwork or house work I like to play with my friends in video games. I also like to keep exercising every once in a awhile so I take my bike out and ride for 20 minutes. If it is raining or the internet goes out I like to build things with legos and show off them. I am in 7th grade and I have been doing these hobbies for 3 years now and would like to continue for a long time. I also like to practice my coding on codepen to improve my projects.</p>
